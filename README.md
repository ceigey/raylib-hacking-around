# raylib-hacking-around

## Introduction

Following these examples and tweaking them: [Raylib examples](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html).

Used these steps to build `libraylib.a`: [Working on macOS](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-macOS).

Realistically though you just need to download a release and place `libraylib.a` somewhere in your project along with `raylib.h`, and `#include` them.

Currently builds on macOS 10.14.


## Building

```sh

./build.sh

```


## Code style

StandardJS in C but with semicolons.

(Just be glad I didn't go for some pseudo Elmish Schema syntax...)
